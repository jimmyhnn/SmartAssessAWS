AWS Elastic Beanstalk Terraform Deployment
This project uses Terraform to provision an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for deploying a sample Node.js application. It includes the necessary AWS infrastructure, such as an S3 bucket, IAM roles, and an Elastic Beanstalk environment, to host the application.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

Terraform (v1.0+)
AWS CLI (configured with credentials)
Node.js and npm (for managing your Node.js application)
Git (optional, for version control)
AWS Setup
Create an AWS account if you don't already have one.
Configure your AWS CLI with the required credentials:
bash
Copy code
aws configure
Ensure you have sufficient permissions:
S3: Full access to manage S3 buckets.
Elastic Beanstalk: Full access to manage applications and environments.
IAM: Permissions to create and manage IAM roles.
Setup and Usage
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
3. Upload the Application
Ensure your Node.js application is packaged as a ZIP file and located in the /app directory of this repository. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd app
zip -r app.zip .  # Creates a ZIP archive of the app directory
Move the app.zip to the root directory of your project.

4. Create the Infrastructure
Run the following command to apply the Terraform configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply -auto-approve
Terraform will:

Create an S3 bucket to store application artifacts.
Deploy the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Use the provided Node.js application to initialize the environment.
5. Monitor Environment Creation
Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
Confirm that the environment (sample-nodejs-env) is in the "Ready" state.
6. Access the Application
After the environment is successfully created, Terraform will output the application's public URL:

bash
Copy code
Outputs:

app_url = "http://<your-environment-endpoint>"
Project Structure
graphql
Copy code
.
├── main.tf                   # Terraform configuration for infrastructure
├── variables.tf              # Variables for customizable settings
├── outputs.tf                # Outputs, such as the app URL
├── app/                      # Node.js application directory
│   ├── app.zip               # Packaged application ZIP (for deployment)
│   └── simpleapp.js          # Node.js application entry point
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
Cleanup
To tear down the infrastructure and avoid unnecessary AWS charges, run:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy -auto-approve
Troubleshooting
Error: The specified bucket does not exist: Ensure the S3 bucket specified in main.tf exists or let Terraform create it for you.

Error: Waiting for Elastic Beanstalk Environment creation: Check the Elastic Beanstalk Console for detailed logs.

Node.js Application Issues: Ensure your application is packaged correctly in app.zip.
